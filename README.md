life
====

Simple python implementation of Conway's Game of Life.
The Game of Life Universe is drawn in the console:
'X's are living cells, '.'s are dead cells.

Run as ./life.py <seedFile.txt>
where the seed file contains the initial state of the universe.  The universe
must be a square, with sides of any length.
